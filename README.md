# Skit

_Move lightly and rapidly_

Skit aims to be a simple way to record short thoughts and ideas with a
lightweight path to refinement.

We all go throughout our days with ideas floating around in our heads. Wouldn't
it be nice to get them out of our heads so we don't forget them, however
silly and incomplete they are, so we can potential refine them later into
something that could promote better decisions and change.
